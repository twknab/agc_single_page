# Font Notes

I did not have the `Glober` font, and couldn't find any freeware versions -- so I opted to do everything with Roboto, matching as very best as I could, despite not having the same font as in the mockup. I believe I could get pixel-perfect if I could emulate the font. Note that sans-serif is a 3rd fall back option in the event that Glober is not found on the system and if Roboto fails to load via Google Fonts.

1. The AlgaeCal logo is all HTML -- the little circle is done via CSS.
