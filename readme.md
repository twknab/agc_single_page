# Font Notes

I did not have the `Glober` font, and couldn't find any freeware versions -- so I opted to do everything with Roboto, matching as very best as I could, despite not having the same font as in the mockup. I believe I could get pixel-perfect if I could emulate the font. Note that sans-serif is a 3rd fall back option in the event that Glober is not found on the system and if Roboto fails to load via Google Fonts.

# Product Image Notes

If I could source higher resolution images of the bottles, I could improve the quality and clarity of the product images (especially at larger screen sizes).

# Cool Features

1. The AlgaeCal logo is all HTML -- the little circle is done via CSS.
